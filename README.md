# My first Kaggle competition ðŸ’»
*Duke University Fall 2021 AIPI 520 Class Kaggle Competition*

## Project Description: 
"Our objective in this competition is to predict which previous patrons of our customer, an orchestra, will purchase a season subscription to the upcoming 2014-15 concert season. There are different levels of subscription, but we are simply going to predict whether they will purchase a subscription (of any level) or not. Our client has provided us a number of data files containing useful data on all previous patrons (see "data" folder in this repo). In this competition you will be submitting your "soft predictions" (your probabilistic prediction that they will purchase a subscription)."

"We have received several data files as described below to use in our model. Our training dataset in train.csv contains account IDs of patrons along with a target label (0 or 1) indicating whether they purchased a subscription for the 2014-15 concert season. Our objective is to predict whether the patrons listed in the test.csv file will purchase subscriptions or not. Our scoring metric for this competition is AUROC."

## Results: 4th
